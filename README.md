# DeepArchitect: Automatically Designing and Training Deep Architectures

**IMPORTANT:**

This repo is not under active development.
It contains a prototype for the ideas described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08792).
See our [NeurIPS 2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13404) for the latest developments.
The code and documentation for the latest framework can be found [here](https://github.com/negrinho/deep_architect).

This repository contains a Python implementation of the DeepArchitect framework described in
[our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08792).
To get familiar with the framework, we recommend starting with
[this tutorial](https://github.com/negrinho/deep_architect_legacy/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb).

A tar file with the logs of the experiments in the paper is available [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~negrinho/assets/papers/deep_architect/logs.tar.gz). You can download it, unzip it in the top folder of the repo, and generate the plots of the paper using `plots.py`. The logs are composed of text and pickle files. It may be informative to inspect them. The experiments reported in the paper can be reproduced using `experiments.py`.
